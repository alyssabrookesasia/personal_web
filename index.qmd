# About Me

![](./images/headshot.jpeg)

I am a fifth-year clinical psychology PhD candidate working with Dr. James Li. My research interests include:

1. The **structure** of psychopathology, with a focus on externalizing behaviors and traits (e.g., antisocial behavior, substance use, impulsivity) as defined in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) framework.

How externalizing **develops** across the lifespan, with an emphasis on childhood and adolescence.

Interplay between **genes and environment** on developmental trajectories of externalizing.

Clinically, I am interested in psychological and forensic assessments and improving behavioral health outcomes for youth in the juvenile legal system.
