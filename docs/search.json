My research interests include:\n\nThe structure of psychopathology, with a focus on externalizing behaviors and traits (e.g., antisocial behavior, substance use, impulsivity) as defined in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology (HiTOP) framework.\n\nHow externalizing develops across the lifespan, with an emphasis on childhood and adolescence.\nInterplay between genes and environment on developmental trajectories of externalizing.\nClinically, I am interested in psychological and forensic assessments and improving behavioral health outcomes for youth in the juvenile legal system.\n\n\nPersonal Statement"

A positive mentoring relationship fosters not only professional success of the mentee, but also their growth across many domains, including but not limited to confidence, initiative, perseverance, courage, and resilience. My mentorship aims to help students develop into young independent researchers who bring innovation and self-representation to the field.\nFor a positive mentoring relationship, I abide to several principles. First, I provide unconditional positive regard, because growth does not take place without self-faith and belongingness, to which unconditional positive regard is the key. Next, I foster an open and safe environment, since problems cannot be solved and progress cannot be made if the expression of feelings or thoughts is withheld. Lastly, I ensure that my mentorship unbiasedly serves the mentee, not the mentor: the purpose of mentoring is to scaffold the development of an independent person, and not to benefit or extend myself.\n\n\n\n\nPersonalize mentorship to specific mentee.\nEmphasize the mentee’s strengths not weaknesses.\nGuide the mentee in exploring academic interests.\nEstablish the mentee’s confidence and self-efficacy.\nFoster the mentee’s research related skills.\nHelp the mentee in developing independence."
